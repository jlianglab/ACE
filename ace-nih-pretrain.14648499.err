This module is intended solely for building or source activating user
python environments, i.e.,

    mamba create -n myenv -c conda-forge

or

    source activate myenv

To list available environments, run:

Our suggested max number of worker in current system is 1, which is smaller than what this DataLoader is going to create. Please be aware that excessive worker creation might get DataLoader running slow or even freeze, lower the worker number to avoid potential slowness/freeze if necessary.
